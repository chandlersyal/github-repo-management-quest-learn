git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/github-repo-management-quest.git
cd github-repo-management-quest
code .
```

### 2. Run Setup Workflows

In your forked repository on GitHub:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Run **"Setup Quest Issues"** workflow (creates sample issues for Scenario 2)
3. Run **"Setup Quest PR"** workflow (creates sample PR for Part 2)

### 3. Verify Setup

- ✅ Repository open in VS Code
- ✅ GitHub Copilot icon visible in status bar
- ✅ Sample issues visible in Issues tab (labeled `quest-sample`)

## Module 0.1: Workspace Basics (10 minutes)

Learn the fundamentals of GitHub Copilot workspace customization.

### What Are Agents and Prompts?

- **Agents** (`.agents` file): Specialized AI assistants with specific roles
- **Prompts** (`.prompts` file): Reusable templates for common tasks

### Quick Start Configuration

Create a `.agents` file in your repository root:

```yaml
documentation-auditor:
  description: Analyzes documentation for gaps and improvements
  instructions: |
    You are a documentation auditor. Focus on:
    - Content completeness and structure
    - Broken links and outdated information
    - Clarity and user experience
    
    Provide actionable recommendations with specific examples.

style-enforcer:
  description: Reviews content for style consistency
  instructions: |
    You are a style guide enforcer. Check for:
    - Grammar and spelling consistency
    - Formatting standards (headings, lists, code blocks)
    - Terminology standardization
    
    Suggest specific corrections with explanations.
```

Create a `.prompts` file:

```yaml
content-audit:
  description: Comprehensive analysis of repository content
  prompt: |
    Analyze this repository's documentation for:
    1. Structure and organization
    2. Content gaps or missing sections
    3. Outdated information
    4. Link validity
    
    Provide: Executive summary, Key findings, Quick wins

quick-fixes:
  description: Identify immediate improvement opportunities
  prompt: |
    Find quick fixes that can be implemented immediately:
    - Broken links
    - Typos or grammar issues
    - Formatting inconsistencies
    - Missing headings
    
    List by priority with estimated effort.
```

### Test Your Configuration

Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`) and try:

```
@documentation-auditor Analyze the structure of the learn-pr/wwl folder
```

```
#content-audit @workspace
```

## Scenario 1: Repository Exploration (25 minutes)

### The Story

You've just been assigned to take over a documentation repository containing Microsoft Learn training modules. Your mission: understand what you've inherited and create an improvement plan.

### Task 1.1: Explore the Repository (10 min)

Use @workspace to map the repository structure:

```
@workspace Give me an overview of this repository. What types of content does it contain? How is it organized?
```

```
@workspace What Microsoft Learn modules are in the learn-pr/wwl folder? List them with their topics.
```

**Key Skills:**
- Using @workspace for repository-wide context
- Understanding folder structures and content types
- Mapping relationships between files

**Full Task Details:** [scenario-1-inheritance/tasks/task-1.1-explore.md](../scenario-1-inheritance/tasks/task-1.1-explore.md)

### Task 1.2: Identify Issues (10 min)

Use Copilot to find problems:

```
@workspace Analyze the learn-pr/wwl modules for potential issues like outdated ms.date values, broken includes, or inconsistent metadata.
```

```
@documentation-auditor Review the get-started-lakehouses module for content quality issues.
```

**Key Skills:**
- Targeted issue detection
- Pattern recognition across files
- Using custom agents for specialized analysis

**Full Task Details:** [scenario-1-inheritance/tasks/task-1.2-identify.md](../scenario-1-inheritance/tasks/task-1.2-identify.md)

### Task 1.3: Generate Audit Report (5 min)

Create a comprehensive report:

```
#content-audit @workspace Create an audit report for the learn-pr/wwl folder focusing on the Fabric-related modules.
```

**Key Skills:**
- Generating structured reports
- Prioritizing findings
- Creating actionable recommendations

## Scenario 2: Issue Triage Basics (15 minutes)

### The Story

Your Microsoft Learn documentation repository has accumulated open issues. They range from broken images to outdated content to accessibility concerns. Your challenge: efficiently categorize and prioritize these issues.

### Task 2.1: Issue Categorization (15 min)

Open the Issues tab in your forked repository. You should see 12 sample issues with the `quest-sample` label.

Use Copilot to analyze and categorize:

```
@workspace Analyze the GitHub issues in this repository with the quest-sample label. For each issue, identify:
1. Type (bug, content, accessibility, enhancement)
2. Priority (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, P3-Low)
3. Effort estimate (XS, S, M, L)
4. Quick win? (Yes/No)
```

**Identify Quick Wins:**
```
@workspace From the quest-sample issues, which ones are quick wins that can be fixed in under 30 minutes? List them with the specific fix needed.
```

**Key Skills:**
- Bulk issue analysis with AI
- Consistent categorization frameworks
- Priority-based triage
- Identifying quick wins for immediate action
