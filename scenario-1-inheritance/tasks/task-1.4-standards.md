# Task 1.4: Documentation Standards with GitHub Copilot

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**GitHub Copilot Features:** @workspace, Copilot Chat, template generation

## Objective

Create comprehensive documentation standards using GitHub Copilot to prevent future quality issues and ensure consistency across the Microsoft Learn training modules in the `learn-pr/wwl` repository.

## Context

You've identified numerous issues in the Fabric training modules, many of which could have been prevented with clear standards. GitHub Copilot can help you create professional standards documents by analyzing your audit findings and generating guidelines based on Learn authoring best practices.

This document will serve as:
- A guide for Learn content authors
- A checklist for module reviewers
- The basis for automated YAML and content validation
- The foundation for your Learn content quality culture

## Setup

Have your `quality-audit.md` and `audit-report.md` open for reference.
Open Copilot Chat: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)

## Tasks

### 1. Generate Markdown Formatting Standards

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace Based on the formatting issues found in my audit of the learn-pr/wwl modules:

[Paste formatting issues from your audit]

Create a "Learn Module Formatting Standards" section for our documentation that includes:
1. YAML metadata requirements (ms.date, author, ms.service fields)
2. Module structure rules (proper index.yml to unit .yml to includes/*.md flow)
3. Code block formatting (always use ``` with language specifiers like python, yaml, sql)
4. Cross-reference link formatting (proper [!include[]] syntax)
5. Image and media conventions (media/ folder structure, alt text requirements)

For each rule provide:
- The standard (what to do)
- Why it matters (rationale for Learn platform)
- ✅ Good example
- ❌ Bad example

Format as markdown suitable for LEARN_MODULE_STANDARDS.md file.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Analyzes issues found in your audit
- Generates specific standards to prevent those issues
- Provides rationale for each standard
- Creates clear examples (good vs bad)

**Follow-up to Refine:**
```
@workspace Add standards for heading capitalization (title case vs sentence case)
```

**Deliverable:** Create `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` with formatting section

---

### 2. Create Content Structure Templates

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace Create templates for different Microsoft Learn module content types:

1. Module index.yml template (module metadata and unit listing)
2. Learning unit .yml template (unit with knowledge check)
3. Exercise unit .yml template (hands-on activity)
4. Conceptual content template (includes/*.md understanding)
5. Tutorial content template (includes/*.md step-by-step)

For each template, define:
- Required YAML fields with descriptions
- Required content sections
- Example structure showing includes/ references
- When to use this template

Format as copy-paste ready templates following Learn authoring guidelines.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Generates professional documentation templates
- Based on documentation best practices (Diátaxis framework)
- Creates ready-to-use markdown structures
- Provides guidance on template selection

**Refine Templates:**
```
@workspace Add a frontmatter section to each template with metadata fields
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Document Templates" section with 4+ templates

---

### 3. Define Quality Requirements

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace Based on quality issues from my Learn modules audit, create enforceable quality requirements:

[Reference your audit findings]

Include standards for:
1. ms.date freshness (maximum age, update triggers, automation)
2. Code example validation (PySpark/SQL examples must run in Fabric)
3. Include file references (all [!include[]] paths must resolve)
4. Images and media (alt text required, media/ folder organization, screenshot currency)
5. Prerequisites accuracy (Fabric capacity requirements, access needs)

Make each requirement:
- Specific and measurable for Learn publishing
- Enforceable through build validation or review
- Practical for content authors to follow

Provide implementation guidance for each.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Converts audit findings into preventive standards
- Creates measurable, testable requirements
- Suggests automation approaches
- Provides implementation steps

**Add Automation:**
```
@workspace For each quality requirement, suggest a tool or script that could automate the check
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Quality Requirements" section

---

### 4. Create Review Process Documentation

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
@workspace Create a documentation review process that would catch the issues we found:

Define:
1. Who reviews documentation (peer, SME, tech writer roles)
2. Review workflow (branch → PR → review → merge)
3. Reviewer checklist (specific items to verify)
4. Merge criteria (what must pass before merging)
5. How to use GitHub Copilot during reviews

Make this practical - not overly bureaucratic but thorough enough to catch quality issues.

Include a copy-paste checklist reviewers can use.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Designs pragmatic review workflow
- Creates actionable checklist
- Balances thoroughness with efficiency
- Includes Copilot-assisted review steps

**Example Copilot-Enhanced Review Step:**
```markdown

   ```

2. Verify technical accuracy:
   ```
   @workspace Are the code examples in this PR correct and up-to-date?
   ```

3. Check consistency:
   ```
   @workspace Compare the style in this PR to existing documentation
   ```
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Review and Approval Process" section

---

### 5. Define Style and Voice Guidelines

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**
