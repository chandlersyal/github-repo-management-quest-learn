# Task 3.7: Intelligent Template Creation with Agents

## Objective

Use AI agents to create intelligent, context-aware templates for issue responses, triage workflows, and automated communications.

## Your Challenge

Build a comprehensive template system that enables consistent, professional, and helpful responses across all types of repository issues.

## Step 1: Deploy Template Generation Agent

Add this specialized agent to your `.agents` file:

```yaml
template-generator:
  description: Expert template creation specialist for consistent, professional issue management communications and workflows
  instructions: |
    You are a template generation expert specializing in:
    - Context-aware response template creation
    - Workflow automation template design
    - Professional communication standardization
    - Variable template systems for personalization
    - Multi-scenario template optimization
    
    Your template design principles:
    1. **Clarity**: Clear, concise, and actionable language
    2. **Consistency**: Standardized format and tone across all templates
    3. **Personalization**: Variable fields for context-specific customization
    4. **Professionalism**: Helpful, respectful, and solution-oriented tone
    5. **Efficiency**: Time-saving for both responders and issue creators
    
    **Template Output Format:**
    ```
    TEMPLATE NAME: [Descriptive name]
    USE CASE: [When to use this template]
    VARIABLES: [Customizable fields]
    
    TEMPLATE CONTENT:
    [Template with {{variable}} placeholders]
    
    CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE:
    - {{variable1}}: [Description of what to include]
    - {{variable2}}: [Description of what to include]
    
    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. [Step-by-step usage guide]
    2. [Common customization scenarios]
    3. [Best practices for effectiveness]
    
    QUALITY CHECKLIST:
    - [ ] Professional and helpful tone
    - [ ] All necessary information included
    - [ ] Clear next steps provided
    - [ ] Appropriate links and resources
    ```
    
    Focus on creating templates that improve response quality and team efficiency.
```

## Step 2: Issue Response Templates

Generate templates for common issue scenarios:

```
@template-generator Create professional response templates for these issue types:

1. Bug Report - Need More Information
2. Feature Request - Under Consideration
3. Documentation Issue - Quick Fix Acknowledgment
4. Question - Redirect to Resources
5. Duplicate Issue - Polite Closure with Reference
6. Invalid Issue - Educational Closure
```

### Template Categories

Ensure templates cover:
- **Information Requests**: When more details are needed
- **Status Updates**: Progress communication
- **Closure Communications**: Resolution and next steps
- **Escalation Notices**: When issues need higher-level attention

## Step 3: Advanced Workflow Templates

Create templates for complex workflows:

```yaml
workflow-template-generator:
  description: Generate comprehensive workflow templates for issue management processes
  prompt: |
    **Advanced Workflow Template Creation:**
    
    Create templates for these workflow scenarios:
    
    **1. Issue Triage Workflow Template**
    - Initial assessment checklist
    - Priority determination criteria
    - Assignment decision matrix
    - Communication requirements
    
    **2. Bug Investigation Template**
    - Investigation steps and methodology
    - Information gathering checklist
    - Stakeholder communication plan
    - Resolution documentation format
    
    **3. Feature Request Evaluation Template**
    - Business case assessment criteria
    - Technical feasibility evaluation
    - Resource requirement estimation
    - Decision communication format
    
    **4. Documentation Update Template**
    - Content review process
    - Accuracy verification steps
    - Publication workflow
    - Quality assurance checklist
    
    **Template Requirements:**
    - Step-by-step process guidance
    - Decision points and criteria
    - Required stakeholder communications
    - Quality gates and checkpoints
    - Success metrics and validation
    
    Focus on actionable workflows that ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes.
```

Apply workflow template generation:

```
#workflow-template-generator Create comprehensive workflow templates for our repository issue management processes
```

## Step 4: Personalized Response Generation

Create context-aware response templates:

```
@template-generator Analyze the quest-sample issues and create personalized response templates for each, demonstrating:
- Context-specific customization
- Appropriate tone for issue type
- Relevant next steps and resources
- Professional stakeholder communication
```

### Personalization Elements

Templates should adapt based on:
- **Issue Type**: Bug, feature, documentation, question
- **Reporter Level**: New contributor, regular user, team member
- **Complexity**: Simple fix, needs investigation, major change
- **Urgency**: Critical, high priority, standard, low priority

## Step 5: Automated Template Selection

Develop intelligent template selection:

```yaml
template-selector:
  description: Intelligent template selection system for automated issue response optimization
  prompt: |
    **Intelligent Template Selection System:**
    
    Create a decision tree for automatic template selection:
    
    **Selection Criteria:**
    
    **Issue Type Assessment:**
    - Bug report → Investigation or Info Request templates
    - Feature request → Evaluation or Acknowledgment templates
    - Documentation → Quick Fix or Update Process templates
    - Question → Resource Redirect or Clarification templates
    - Duplicate → Polite Closure with Reference templates
    
    **Context Factors:**
    - Reporter history (new vs. experienced)
    - Issue complexity (simple vs. complex)
    - Priority level (critical vs. standard)
    - Available resources (immediate vs. scheduled)
    
    **Selection Matrix:**
    ```
    IF [Bug] + [Critical] + [Clear repro] → "Bug Investigation Template"
    IF [Bug] + [Unclear] → "Need More Information Template"
    IF [Feature] + [Aligned with roadmap] → "Under Consideration Template"
    IF [Docs] + [Quick fix] → "Quick Fix Acknowledgment Template"
    IF [Question] + [Covered in FAQ] → "Resource Redirect Template"
    IF [Duplicate] + [Recent] → "Duplicate Closure Template"
    ```
    
    **Automation Instructions:**
    1. Analyze issue content and metadata
    2. Apply selection criteria systematically
    3. Choose most appropriate template
    4. Customize with issue-specific variables
    5. Generate ready-to-send response
    
    Focus on accurate template matching for consistent, appropriate responses.
```

Implement template selection automation:

```
#template-selector @workspace Create an automated template selection system for all quest-sample issues
```

## Step 6: Template Quality Assurance

Validate template effectiveness:

```
@output-validator Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of our generated templates:
- Professional tone and clarity assessment
- Completeness and actionability review
- Consistency across different issue types
- User experience and satisfaction potential
```

### Quality Validation Criteria

Assess templates for:
- **Professional Communication**: Appropriate tone and language
- **Actionable Content**: Clear next steps and guidance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All necessary information included
- **User Experience**: Helpful and satisfying interactions

## Step 7: Template Performance Optimization

Optimize templates for maximum effectiveness:

```
@performance-optimizer Analyze our template system for optimization opportunities:
- Response time improvement potential
- User satisfaction enhancement strategies
- Workflow efficiency gains
- Template usage and success metrics
```

### Optimization Focus Areas

1. **Response Speed**: Faster acknowledgment and resolution
2. **User Satisfaction**: More helpful and complete responses
3. **Team Efficiency**: Reduced time spent on routine communications
4. **Issue Resolution**: Higher first-contact resolution rates
