# Task 3.3: Creating Issue and Response Templates with GitHub Copilot

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**GitHub Copilot Features:** @workspace, template generation, YAML formatting

## Objective

Use GitHub Copilot to create professional GitHub issue templates, response templates, and automation configurations that improve issue quality and reduce maintenance burden—preventing the chaos you just cleaned up.

## Context

Your backlog analysis revealed issues that were:
- Missing critical information (8 issues needed "more info")
- Inconsistently formatted
- Hard to categorize
- Time-consuming to triage

GitHub issue templates solve these problems by:
- Requiring specific information upfront
- Providing consistent structure
- Enabling automatic labeling
- Making triage faster

GitHub Copilot can generate:
- GitHub issue form templates (YAML)
- Classic markdown templates
- Saved replies for common responses
- Issue configuration files

This task shows you how to prevent future backlog chaos with good templates.

## Setup

1. **Review your previous analysis:**
   - `issue-analysis.md` (what info was missing)
   - `issue-relationships.md` (common patterns)

2. **Open Copilot Chat:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)

3. **Create templates directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
   ```

## Tasks

### 1. Generate Bug Report Template

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Based on the issues I analyzed (which had missing information), create a GitHub issue form template for bug reports.

The template should:
1. Use GitHub's YAML form syntax (not markdown)
2. Require essential information we found was often missing:
   - Description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment (OS, version, Python version)
   - Error messages/logs
3. Include helpful hints and examples
4. Auto-label as "bug" and "needs-triage"
5. Make required fields actually required
6. Use appropriate input types (textarea, dropdown, checkboxes)

File path: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml

Make it friendly and helpful, not intimidating.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Generates proper YAML structure
- Uses GitHub's form syntax
- Creates required vs optional fields
- Includes helpful placeholders
- Adds auto-labeling

**Follow-up to Refine:**

```
@workspace Add a dropdown for priority (P0-P3) so reporters can indicate urgency
```

```
@workspace Add a checkbox asking if they searched existing issues first
```

**Deliverable:** Save as `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`

---

- Typos and errors
- Unclear instructions
- Missing information
- Broken links
- Outdated content

Fields needed:
1. **Issue type:** Dropdown (typo, unclear, missing, broken link, outdated, other)
2. **Location:** Where in the docs (file path or URL)
3. **Current content:** What it says now
4. **Problem:** What's wrong with it
5. **Suggested fix:** How to improve it (optional)
6. **Additional context:** Screenshots, etc. (optional)

Auto-label as "docs" and "needs-triage"

File: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Creates docs-specific template
- Categorizes doc issue types
- Requires location information
- Makes fixes easier with current/suggested content

**Deliverable:** Save as `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml`

---

### 4. Generate Question Template

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Create a GitHub issue form template for questions and support requests.

Many issues in our backlog were actually questions (e.g., "how do I...").

Fields:
1. **What are you trying to do?** (required)
2. **What have you tried?** (required)
3. **Where did you look for answers?** (docs, GitHub, etc.)
4. **Environment:** OS, version (optional)
5. **Additional context:** (optional)

Include:
- Friendly tone (questions are welcome!)
- Links to documentation
- Suggestion to check FAQ first
- Auto-label as "question" and "support"

Also include a note: "For general discussion, consider GitHub Discussions instead of issues"

File: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.yml
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Creates welcoming question template
- Encourages self-service first
- Gathers useful context
- Directs to appropriate channels

**Deliverable:** Save as `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.yml`

---

### 5. Create Template Configuration File

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Create the GitHub issue template config file that:

1. Customizes the "New Issue" page
2. Adds a blank issue option for edge cases
3. Links to external resources:
   - Documentation: https://docs.example.com
   - Discussions: Link to GitHub Discussions
   - Security issues: Link to security policy

File: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml

Use proper GitHub config.yml syntax.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Generates config.yml
- Customizes issue creation experience
- Adds helpful links
- Enables blank issue option

**Deliverable:** Save as `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`

---

### 6. Generate Saved Replies for Common Responses

Create templates for:

1. **Requesting more information:**
   - When issue is vague
   - Polite, specific about what's needed
   - Template format for GitHub saved replies

2. **Closing as duplicate:**
   - Thanks reporter
   - Links to original issue
   - Invites them to add info there

3. **Closing as won't fix:**
   - Explains why (with kindness)
   - Suggests alternatives if applicable
   - Leaves door open for discussion

4. **Closing as needs discussion:**
   - Invites to GitHub Discussions
   - Explains why discussion better than issue
   - Provides discussion link

5. **Asking for reproduction:**
   - Politely requests minimal reproduction
   - Explains why it's helpful
   - Offers to help create one

6. **Welcoming first contribution:**
   - Thanks for interest
   - Links to contributor guide
   - Offers mentorship

Each template should be:

1. All labels we should have (from our analysis):
   - Type labels (bug, feature, docs, question)
   - Priority labels (P0-P3)
   - Status labels (needs-info, duplicate, ready)
   - Component labels (api, cli, docs, installer)

2. For each label:
   - Name
   - Color code (hex)
   - Description
   - When to use it
   - Example issues

3. Labeling decision tree:
   - "If the issue is X, label it Y"
   - Flowchart in Mermaid format

4. GitHub CLI commands to create all labels

This helps maintainers label consistently.

File: LABELING_GUIDE.md
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Documents complete label system
- Provides clear guidelines
- Creates decision flowchart
- Includes setup commands

**Deliverable:** Save as `LABELING_GUIDE.md`

---

### 8. Generate Auto-Labeling Workflow

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically labels issues based on content.

The workflow should:
1. Trigger on issue creation/editing
2. Auto-label based on keywords:
   - "bug", "error", "crash" → add "bug" label
   - "feature", "request", "enhancement" → add "feature" label
   - "docs", "documentation", "typo" → add "docs" label
   - "how to", "question" → add "question" label
3. Auto-label based on title patterns
4. Add "needs-triage" to all new issues
5. Comment with welcome message on first-time issues

Use proper GitHub Actions YAML syntax.

File: .github/workflows/issue-labeler.yml
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Generates GitHub Actions workflow
- Uses keyword detection
- Automates basic triage
- Welcomes new contributors

**Alternative - Simple Approach:**

```
@workspace Actually, let's use GitHub's built-in issue labeler action. Create the configuration for that instead.

File: .github/labeler.yml
```

**Deliverable:** Save as `.github/workflows/issue-labeler.yml` or `.github/labeler.yml`

## Creating Labels via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Type labels
gh label create "bug" --description "Something isn't working" --color d73a4a
gh label create "feature" --description "New feature request" --color 0075ca
gh label create "enhancement" --description "Improvement to existing feature" --color a2eeef
gh label create "docs" --description "Documentation issue" --color 0075ca
gh label create "question" --description "Question or support request" --color d876e3
gh label create "discussion" --description "Needs discussion" --color cc317c

# Priority labels
gh label create "P0-critical" --description "Critical, needs immediate fix" --color b60205
gh label create "P1-high" --description "Important, fix soon" --color d93f0b
gh label create "P2-normal" --description "Standard priority" --color fbca04
gh label create "P3-low" --description "Nice to have" --color c2e0c6

# Status labels
gh label create "needs-info" --description "Waiting for more information" --color d876e3
gh label create "needs-triage" --description "Needs initial review" --color ededed
gh label create "duplicate" --description "Duplicate of another issue" --color cfd3d7
gh label create "wont-fix" --description "Will not be fixed" --color ffffff
gh label create "ready" --description "Ready to work on" --color 0e8a16
gh label create "in-progress" --description "Being worked on" --color fbca04
gh label create "blocked" --description "Blocked by something" --color b60205

# Component labels
gh label create "api" --description "API related" --color 1d76db
gh label create "cli" --description "CLI related" --color 1d76db
gh label create "installer" --description "Installation process" --color 1d76db
gh label create "windows" --description "Windows-specific" --color 5319e7
gh label create "macos" --description "macOS-specific" --color 5319e7

## Examples

### Example 1: Installation Bug

**Issue:** "Can't install on Windows 11, gets error about paths"

**Labels:**
- `bug` (it's broken)
- `P1-high` (blocks Windows users)
- `installer` (component)
- `windows` (platform)
- `ready` (has enough info)

**Rationale:** Serious bug affecting specific platform, clear reproduction steps.

---

### Example 2: Vague Bug Report

**Issue:** "It doesn't work"

**Labels:**
- `bug` (seems to be a bug)
- `needs-info` (too vague)
- `needs-triage` (needs review)

**Action:** Request more information using saved reply template.

---

### Example 3: Feature Request

**Issue:** "Add support for PostgreSQL database"

**Labels:**
- `feature` (new functionality)
- `P2-normal` (standard priority)
- `needs-triage` (needs discussion on feasibility)

**Rationale:** New feature, needs team review before committing.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Add labels immediately** - Don't let issues sit unlabeled
2. **Use multiple labels** - Combine type + priority + component
3. **Update labels as status changes** - Remove `needs-info` when info is provided
4. **Be consistent** - Follow this guide, don't make up new labels
5. **Use component labels** - Helps filter and assign issues
6. **Prioritize honestly** - Not everything is P0!

*Consistent labeling makes triage faster and helps contributors find issues to work on!*

## GitHub Copilot Tips for This Task

### Generating YAML Templates

**Use @workspace for consistency:**

```
@workspace Create a GitHub issue form template matching the style and fields of the existing templates
```

### Getting Proper Syntax

**Ask Copilot about syntax:**

```
@workspace What's the correct YAML syntax for GitHub issue form dropdown fields?
```

### Creating Saved Replies

**Generate multiple variations:**

```
@workspace Create 5 different polite ways to request more information from an issue reporter
```

### Refining Templates

**Iterate and improve:**

```
@workspace Add a helpful hint/placeholder to each field in this template
@workspace Make this template more friendly and less intimidating
```
