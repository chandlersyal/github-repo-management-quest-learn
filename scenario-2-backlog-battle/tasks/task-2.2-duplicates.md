# Task 3.2: Finding Duplicates and Relationships with GitHub Copilot

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**GitHub Copilot Features:** @workspace, semantic similarity analysis, pattern recognition

## Objective

Use GitHub Copilot to identify duplicate issues, find related issues that should be linked or solved together, and detect conflicting requests that need discussion—saving hours of manual comparison.

## Context

In a backlog of 27 issues, manually finding duplicates and relationships requires:
- Reading each issue multiple times
- Remembering details from earlier issues
- Comparing symptoms, requests, and contexts
- Tracking relationships in your head

This could take 2-3 hours manually. GitHub Copilot can compare all issues simultaneously, identifying:
- Exact duplicates (same problem, different reporters)
- Related issues (different aspects of same underlying problem)
- Conflicting requests (users want opposite things)
- Issues that should be solved together
- Common root causes

## Setup

1. **Have your issue-analysis.md open** from Task 3.1

2. **Open Copilot Chat:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)

3. **Access to issues:**
   ```bash
   cd scenario-3-backlog-battle/issues
   ```

## Tasks

### 1. Find Exact Duplicates

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Analyze all 27 issues in ALL_ISSUES.md to find exact duplicates.

Look for issues that:
1. Report the same problem
2. Request the same feature
3. Ask the same question
4. Have essentially identical content (even if worded differently)

For each duplicate set:
1. List all issue numbers involved
2. Explain why they're duplicates
3. Identify which issue should be the "primary" one (most detailed/complete)
4. Recommend which issues to close as duplicates
5. Draft a closing comment for the duplicate issues

Focus on semantic similarity, not just exact word matches. If two issues describe the same problem in different words, they're duplicates.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Compares all issues semantically
- Identifies same problems with different wording
- Determines most complete issue
- Drafts diplomatic closing comments

**Example Prompt for Specific Comparison:**

```
@workspace Are issues #1 and #13 duplicates? Compare their descriptions and determine if they're reporting the same problem.
```

**Deliverable:** Create `issue-relationships.md` with "Exact Duplicates" section

---

### 2. Identify Related Issues

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Find groups of related issues that aren't exact duplicates but are connected.

Look for issues that:
1. Share the same root cause (different symptoms, same underlying problem)
2. Affect the same component or feature
3. Could be solved by the same fix
4. Should be worked on together
5. Should reference each other

For each related group:
1. List issue numbers
2. Explain the relationship
3. Describe the common thread
4. Suggest whether to:
   - Create an epic/parent issue combining them
   - Link them with "related to" references
   - Solve them together in one PR
   - Keep separate but coordinate timing
5. Estimate effort if solved together vs separately

Present as groups with clear relationships.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Finds issues with common themes
- Identifies shared root causes
- Groups by component/feature
- Recommends coordination strategies

**Example Output Structure:**

```markdown
### Related Group 1: Windows Installation Issues

**Issues:** #3, #7, #15, #19

**Relationship:** All report installation failures on Windows due to path handling

**Common Thread:**
- Windows path separators (backslash vs forward slash)
- PowerShell vs CMD differences
- Missing Windows-specific instructions

**Root Cause:** Code doesn't properly handle Windows paths

**Recommendation:**
- Create epic issue: "Fix Windows installation experience"
- Solve all together in one comprehensive fix
- Estimated effort: 5 days together vs 8 days separately (40% savings)

**Benefits of solving together:**
- Single root cause fix addresses all
- Comprehensive testing on Windows
- Better documentation
- More efficient use of time
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Related Issue Groups" section

---

### 3. Detect Conflicting Requests

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Identify issues that conflict with each other—where users are requesting opposite or incompatible things.

Look for:
1. Feature requests that contradict each other
2. Issues wanting to add/remove the same feature
3. Requests for incompatible behavior
4. Different opinions on how something should work

For each conflict:
1. List the conflicting issue numbers
2. Explain the conflict clearly
3. Describe what each side wants
4. Suggest potential resolutions:
   - Make it configurable (option to enable/disable)
   - Find a compromise approach
   - Prioritize one over the other (with rationale)
   - Start a discussion to gather more input
5. Draft a comment explaining the conflict and asking for input

These need discussion before any work can start!
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Identifies contradictory requests
- Explains both perspectives
- Suggests resolution approaches
- Helps facilitate discussion

**Example:**

```markdown
### Conflict: Automatic Updates

**Issues in Conflict:**
- **Issue #8:** "Add automatic updates" (wants auto-update feature)
- **Issue #20:** "Disable automatic updates - they're annoying" (wants to disable it)

**The Conflict:**
- Issue #8 user wants tool to auto-update for security/features
- Issue #20 user finds auto-updates disruptive to workflow
- Can't please both with a single on/off behavior

**Perspectives:**
- **Pro auto-update:** Keeps users secure, reduces support burden
- **Anti auto-update:** User control, avoid disruption, bandwidth concerns

**Suggested Resolution:**
Make auto-updates configurable with sensible default:
- Default: Auto-update enabled (security best practice)
- Option: Users can disable in settings (user control)
- Include: "Check for updates" manual option
- Notify: Alert users of available updates if auto disabled

**Next Steps:**
1. Create discussion issue: "Automatic update behavior - feedback needed"
2. Link both #8 and #20
3. Propose configurable solution
4. Gather community input
5. Make decision based on majority preference + security considerations
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Conflicting Requests" section

---

### 4. Map Issue Dependencies

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Identify dependencies between issues—where one issue blocks or depends on another.

Look for:
1. Issues that can't be fixed until another is resolved
2. Features that require other features to be built first
3. Bugs that will be fixed by implementing a feature
4. Issues that should be tackled in a specific order

For each dependency:
1. Issue that's blocked (can't proceed)
2. Blocking issue (must be done first)
3. Why there's a dependency
4. Whether it's a hard blocker or soft dependency
5. Recommended work order

Create a dependency graph showing the relationships.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Identifies prerequisites and blockers
- Maps dependencies
- Recommends work order
- Creates visual dependency representation

**Ask for Visual Representation:**

```
@workspace Create a Mermaid diagram showing issue dependencies. Use arrows to show "blocks" relationships.
```

**Example Output:**

```markdown
### Issue Dependencies

**Hard Blockers:**

1. **Issue #5 blocks Issue #11**
   - #5: Add Python 3.11 support
   - #11: Use new Python 3.11 features in examples
   - **Why:** Can't use 3.11 features until 3.11 is supported
   - **Order:** Fix #5 first, then #11

2. **Issue #6 blocks Issues #2, #16**
   - #6: Update API to v2
   - #2, #16: Document new API endpoints
   - **Why:** Can't document what doesn't exist yet
   - **Order:** Ship #6, then update docs

**Soft Dependencies:**

1. **Issue #9 helps Issue #12**
   - #9: Improve error messages
   - #12: Users confused by errors
   - **Relationship:** Better errors might resolve confusion
   - **Suggestion:** Fix #9 first, then reevaluate if #12 still needed

**Dependency Graph:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[#5: Python 3.11 support] --> B[#11: Use 3.11 features]
    C[#6: API v2] --> D[#2: Document endpoint A]
    C --> E[#16: Document endpoint B]
    F[#9: Better errors] -.->|helps| G[#12: Error confusion]
```
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Issue Dependencies" section

### 5. Identify Epic Opportunities

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace Based on the related issues and themes, recommend which groups should become "epic" issues.

An epic is a parent issue that encompasses multiple related smaller issues.

Suggest epics for:
1. Groups of 3+ related issues that share a theme
2. Large features that need to be broken down
3. Multi-step improvements that need coordination

For each proposed epic:
1. Epic title
2. Issues it would include (by number)
3. Epic description (summary of what it encompasses)
4. Benefits of creating an epic
5. Estimated total effort
6. Suggested sub-task breakdown

Provide example epic issue template filled out.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Identifies clusters worth organizing as epics
- Creates epic structure
- Groups related work
- Provides organizational framework

### 6. Draft Duplicate Closing Comments

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace For each duplicate issue we identified, draft a kind and helpful closing comment.

The comment should:
1. Thank the reporter for reporting
2. Explain it's a duplicate (link to primary issue)
3. Invite them to add info to the primary issue if they have more details
4. Provide the "Closes as duplicate" link

Make it friendly and appreciative—we don't want reporters to feel their time was wasted.

Draft one comment for each duplicate issue.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Creates personalized closing messages
- Maintains positive tone
- Directs to primary issue
- Encourages continued participation

**Example:**

```markdown
### Closing Comments for Duplicates

**For Issue #1 (duplicate of #13):**

```markdown
Thanks for reporting this API authentication issue, @user1!

This is a duplicate of #13 which has the same problem reported with more detail. I'm closing this as a duplicate to keep the discussion in one place.

**Please visit #13** and add any additional information you have there—especially if your error logs or environment details are different. The more information we have in one place, the faster we can fix this!

We really appreciate you taking the time to report this. 🙏

Closes as duplicate of #13
```

**For Issue #22 (duplicate of #10):**

```markdown
Thanks for the dark mode request, @user22! I love that you're thinking about the user experience.

This is actually a duplicate of #10 where the same feature is already being discussed. I'm going to close this one and consolidate the conversation there.

**Please check out #10** and add your thoughts on what dark mode should look like! Your input would be valuable.

Thanks again for the suggestion! 👍

Closes as duplicate of #10
```
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Duplicate Closing Comments" section

### 7. Create Cross-Reference Plan

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```
@workspace For all the related issues we've identified, create a plan for cross-referencing them.

Provide:
1. Which issues should reference which (specific issue pairs)
2. What type of reference (blocks, related to, conflicts with, duplicate of)
3. The exact GitHub comment syntax to create the reference
4. Priority order for adding references

Example formats:
- "Blocks #123" (creates blocking relationship)
- "Related to #123" (soft relationship)
- "Duplicate of #123" (marks as duplicate)
- "Conflicts with #123" (indicates conflict)

Make it easy to copy-paste and execute.
```

**What Copilot Does:**
- Creates comprehensive linking plan
- Provides exact GitHub syntax
- Prioritizes important links
- Makes execution simple

**Example Output:**

```markdown
### Cross-Reference Action Plan

#### Priority 1: Mark Duplicates (Do First)

**Issue #1:**
```
This is a duplicate of #13 with more details.

Duplicate of #13
```

**Issue #22:**
```

## GitHub Copilot Tips for This Task

### Finding Duplicates

**Ask Copilot to compare semantically:**

```
@workspace Are these describing the same problem even if worded differently?
```

Copilot can understand that "installation fails" and "can't install" are the same thing.

### Grouping Related Issues

**Look for patterns:**

```
@workspace What common themes emerge across these issues?
@workspace Which issues share the same root cause?
```

### Detecting Conflicts

**Ask explicitly:**

```
@workspace Do any issues contradict each other or request opposite things?
```

### Visual Representations

**Request diagrams:**

```
@workspace Create a Mermaid diagram showing issue relationships
```
