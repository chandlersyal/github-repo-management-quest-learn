# Task 3.6: Automated Duplicate Detection with Agents

## Objective

Use AI agents to automatically identify duplicate and related issues, reducing backlog noise and improving team efficiency.

## Your Challenge

Deploy sophisticated duplicate detection workflows that can identify not just exact duplicates, but also related issues, similar requests, and consolidation opportunities.

## Step 1: Deploy Duplicate Detection Agent

Add this specialized agent to your `.agents` file:

```yaml
duplicate-detector:
  description: Advanced duplicate and similarity detection specialist for issue management and backlog optimization
  instructions: |
    You are a duplicate detection expert specializing in:
    - Exact duplicate identification across different wording
    - Semantic similarity detection for related issues
    - Issue clustering and consolidation opportunities
    - Root cause analysis for recurring problems
    - Consolidation strategy development
    
    Your detection methodology:
    1. **Content Analysis**: Compare issue descriptions, symptoms, and contexts
    2. **Semantic Similarity**: Identify issues addressing the same underlying problem
    3. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect recurring themes and root causes
    4. **Relationship Mapping**: Find dependencies and related issues
    5. **Consolidation Planning**: Recommend merge and closure strategies
    
    **Detection Output Format:**
    ```
    DUPLICATE ANALYSIS RESULTS:
    
    PRIMARY ISSUE: [#ID] [Title]
    CONFIDENCE: [High/Medium/Low] - [Percentage]
    
    DUPLICATES IDENTIFIED:
    - EXACT: [#ID] [Title] - [Confidence %]
    - SIMILAR: [#ID] [Title] - [Confidence %]
    - RELATED: [#ID] [Title] - [Relationship type]
    
    CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
    1. **Keep Primary**: [#ID] - [Reason for selection]
    2. **Close as Duplicate**: [#ID, #ID] - [References to primary]
    3. **Merge Content**: [Specific information to preserve]
    4. **Update Labels**: [Consolidation tracking]
    
    ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
    - **Underlying Issue**: [Core problem description]
    - **Frequency**: [How often this occurs]
    - **Prevention**: [How to avoid future duplicates]
    
    CONSOLIDATION BENEFITS:
    - Reduced noise: [X issues consolidated]
    - Improved focus: [Single issue to track]
    - Better visibility: [Consolidated priority and effort]
    ```
    
    Focus on reducing backlog complexity while preserving important information.
```

## Step 2: Comprehensive Duplicate Analysis

Analyze your sample issues for duplicates and relationships:

```
@duplicate-detector Please analyze all quest-sample issues for duplicates and similarities:
- Compare issue #1 (API authentication bug) with issue #5 (Cannot authenticate)
- Identify any other potential duplicates or related issues
- Suggest consolidation strategies for similar problems
- Recommend prevention strategies for future duplicates
```

### Detection Focus Areas

1. **Exact Duplicates**: Same problem, different wording
2. **Semantic Duplicates**: Same underlying issue, different symptoms
3. **Related Issues**: Connected problems that should be tracked together
4. **Consolidation Opportunities**: Multiple issues that can be merged

## Step 3: Issue Relationship Mapping

Use advanced prompts to map issue relationships:

```yaml
issue-relationship-mapping:
  description: Advanced relationship analysis for issue clustering and dependency identification
  prompt: |
    **Issue Relationship Mapping Protocol:**
    
    Analyze the provided issues and create a relationship map:
    
    **Relationship Types to Identify:**
    1. **Duplicates**: Same problem, different descriptions
    2. **Dependencies**: Issues that block or enable others
    3. **Clusters**: Issues addressing the same component/feature
    4. **Escalations**: Issues that are symptoms of larger problems
    5. **Sequences**: Issues that represent different stages of user journey
    
    **Mapping Output Format:**
    ```
    ISSUE RELATIONSHIP MAP:
    
    CLUSTER 1: [Theme/Component]
    - Primary: #[ID] [Title]
    - Related: #[ID] [Title] - [Relationship type]
    - Dependencies: #[ID] blocks #[ID]
    
    CLUSTER 2: [Theme/Component]
    - Primary: #[ID] [Title]
    - Related: #[ID] [Title] - [Relationship type]
    
    CONSOLIDATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1. Merge Cluster 1 into single tracking issue
    2. Create epic for Cluster 2 with sub-tasks
    3. Close duplicates with proper references
    
    STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:
    - Most common problem type: [Analysis]
    - Resource allocation impact: [Efficiency gains]
    - Priority adjustments needed: [Recommendations]
    ```
    
    Focus on reducing complexity while maintaining traceability.
```

Apply this mapping to your issues:

```
#issue-relationship-mapping @workspace Map relationships between all quest-sample issues and suggest clustering strategies
```

## Step 4: Automated Consolidation Planning

Develop consolidation strategies using your agents:

```
@qa-coordinator Create a comprehensive consolidation plan based on duplicate detection:
- Priority consolidation actions for immediate impact
- Merge strategies that preserve important information  
- Communication plan for stakeholders affected by closures
- Prevention strategies to avoid future duplicates
```

### Consolidation Strategy Components

1. **Immediate Actions**: High-confidence duplicates for quick closure
2. **Review Required**: Medium-confidence matches needing validation
3. **Strategic Merges**: Complex consolidations requiring planning
4. **Prevention Measures**: Process improvements to reduce future duplicates

## Step 5: Duplicate Prevention System

Create proactive duplicate prevention:

```yaml
duplicate-prevention:
  description: Proactive system for preventing duplicate issue creation
  prompt: |
    **Duplicate Prevention Strategy:**
    
    Based on duplicate analysis, create prevention measures:
    
    **Issue Template Improvements:**
    - Add search guidance: "Before creating, search for: [keywords]"
    - Include common duplicate scenarios
    - Provide links to frequently reported issues
    
    **Search Enhancement:**
    - Identify most effective search terms for common issues
    - Create search shortcuts for frequent problems
    - Improve issue titles for better discoverability
    
    **Process Improvements:**
    - Triage checklist including duplicate check
    - Auto-suggestion system for similar issues
    - Regular duplicate cleanup workflows
    
    **Knowledge Base Updates:**
    - FAQ entries for commonly duplicated issues
    - Troubleshooting guides to prevent issue creation
    - User education on effective issue searching
    
    **Prevention Output:**
    - Enhanced issue templates
    - Search keyword recommendations  
    - Process automation suggestions
    - User education materials
    
    Focus on preventing duplicates rather than just detecting them.
```

Implement prevention measures:

```
#duplicate-prevention Create a comprehensive duplicate prevention system based on our analysis patterns
```

## Step 6: Performance Metrics

Measure duplicate detection effectiveness:

```
@performance-optimizer Analyze the effectiveness of our duplicate detection system:
- Detection accuracy and confidence levels
- Time savings from consolidation efforts
- Backlog noise reduction measurements
- Team efficiency improvements
```

### Success Metrics

Track these performance indicators:
- **Detection Accuracy**: Percentage of true positives
- **Time Savings**: Hours saved through consolidation
