# Task 3.4: Draft Responses and Action Plan

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

## Objective

Draft professional responses for representative issues, finalize your action plan, and prepare to execute on your backlog strategy.

## Context

You've categorized, prioritized, identified relationships, and created systems. Now it's time to take action:
- Close issues that should be closed
- Request information where needed
- Draft thoughtful responses
- Create a final execution roadmap

This task brings together everything you've learned and produces immediately actionable outputs.

## Your Challenge

Write responses for 7-10 representative issues covering different scenarios, then finalize your comprehensive backlog action plan.

## Tasks

### 1. Draft Closure Responses (Duplicates)

**For each duplicate issue:**
- Link to the original
- Thank the reporter
- Invite them to subscribe to the original

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
For these duplicate issues from my analysis:

[List duplicate pairs]

Draft professional closure responses following this template:
- Thank the reporter
- Acknowledge the issue
- Link to original issue being tracked
- Invite them to subscribe/contribute there
- Be warm and appreciative

Keep responses 2-3 sentences, friendly and professional.
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Duplicate Closures" section to `issue-responses.md`

### 2. Draft Closure Responses (Out of Scope)

**For wont-fix issues:**
- Thank them sincerely
- Explain why (briefly)
- Suggest alternatives
- Be empathetic

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
For these out-of-scope issues:

Issue #X: [Description]
Reason out of scope: [Your reasoning]

Draft polite closure responses that:
- Thank them for the suggestion
- Briefly explain why it's out of scope (2-3 sentences)

Draft responses that:
- Thank the reporter
- Explain what information is needed to help
- Ask 2-3 specific, clear questions
- Explain why you need this info

### 4. Draft Acknowledgment Responses (High Priority)

**For issues you'll fix:**
- Acknowledge importance
- Explain priority
- Give timeline

Draft acknowledgment responses that:
- Thank them enthusiastically
- Acknowledge the importance/impact
- Explain priority level and why

### 6. Create Implementation Roadmap

**Prompt your AI to:**
- Organize responses by timing
- Create execution checklist
- Sequence the work

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
Based on all my categorization, priorities, and responses:

Create a day-by-day implementation plan for the next 2 weeks:

Day 1:
- Close all duplicates (X issues)
- Close out-of-scope issues (X issues)
- Send information requests (X issues)

Day 2:
- Complete quick wins (specific issues)
- Acknowledge high-priority items

Week 2:

Make this concrete and actionable.
```

**Deliverable:** Add "Implementation Roadmap" section

### 7. Create Success Metrics

**Define how you'll measure progress:**
- Backlog reduction
- Response time
- Issue resolution
- Quality improvements

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
Create success metrics for this backlog cleanup:

Current state:
- 25 total issues
- 0 labeled
- Avg age: X days
- 0 responses

Define metrics for:
1. Week 1 goals (quick wins)
2. Week 4 goals (critical items)
3. Week 8 goals (medium priority)
4. Ongoing health metrics

Include specific, measurable targets.
```

## Duplicate Closures

### Issue #17: Can't install - link returns 404

```markdown
Thanks for reporting this! This is a duplicate of #3 which we're actively tracking.

I'm closing this issue to consolidate discussion, but please subscribe to #3 for updates. If you have additional details that aren't covered there, feel free to add them.

Thanks for helping us improve the documentation!
```

## Out of Scope Closures

### Issue #12: Add video tutorials for every feature

```markdown
Thanks for the suggestion! We appreciate you thinking about ways to improve our documentation.

After team discussion, we've decided video tutorials are outside our current scope because:
- Our small team focuses on written documentation
- Videos require significant ongoing maintenance
- We rely on community video creators for this content

However, check out these community resources:
- [YouTube Channel X] has great video walkthroughs
- [Blog Y] has video tutorials

We're closing this as won't-fix, but we appreciate the suggestion! If you're interested in creating video content, we'd be happy to link to it.
```

**Action:** Close as wont-fix, apply `wont-fix` label

---

## Information Requests

### Issue #8: Docs are confusing

```markdown
Thanks for the feedback! We definitely want to improve any confusing documentation.

To help us address this, could you provide some specifics:

1. Which documentation pages are confusing? (Links would be helpful)
2. What specifically is unclear? (terminology, organization, missing steps, etc.)
3. What were you trying to accomplish when you got confused?
4. What would make it clearer for you?

We'll follow up once we have this information. If we don't hear back within 30 days, we'll close this issue, but you're welcome to reopen it anytime with the details.

**You're ready to execute!**

---

*This completes Scenario 3. You now have all the skills and tools for effective issue management.*
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Drafted 7-10 professional issue responses
- ✅ Covered all scenarios (closures, requests, acknowledgments)
- ✅ Created day-by-day implementation roadmap
- ✅ Defined specific success metrics
- ✅ Responses are professional and empathetic
- ✅ Plan is realistic and actionable

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: Tone Matters</summary>

Every response should:
- Thank the reporter (they took time to help you)
- Be professional but warm
- Set clear expectations
- End positively

Never be dismissive or defensive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: Be Specific</summary>

Vague: "We'll look into this"
Specific: "I'm fixing this today, should be deployed by 5pm"

Specific responses build trust.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3: Close Aggressively</summary>

It's okay to close issues! Reasons to close:
- Duplicates
- Out of scope
- Already fixed
- Can't reproduce after asking for info
- Stale (no response in 30 days)

A clean backlog is healthy.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4: Make Roadmap Realistic</summary>

Better to under-promise and over-deliver.
Add buffer time for unexpected issues.
Don't commit to more than you can actually do.
</details>
