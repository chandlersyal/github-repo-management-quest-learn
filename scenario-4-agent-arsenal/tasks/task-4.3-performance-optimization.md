    - [ ] Completeness: All essential information present?
    - [ ] Accuracy: Technical content appears correct?
    - [ ] Accessibility: Basic inclusive design principles?
    - [ ] Performance: Scannable and user-friendly?
    
    **Output Format (per file):**
    ```
    FILE: [filename]

    STATUS: [PASS/REVIEW/FAIL]
    ISSUES: [Top 2 issues only]
    FIXES: [Specific action items]
    EFFORT: [S/M/L for time required]
    ```
    
    **Batch Summary:**
    - Files analyzed: [count]

    - Critical issues: [count and type]
    - Total effort estimate: [time required]
    - Priority ranking: [files needing immediate attention]
    
    Focus on actionable insights, not detailed explanations.

rapid-issue-triage:
  description: Fast-track issue analysis and categorization
  prompt: |
    **Rapid Issue Triage Protocol (target: 30 seconds per issue):**
    
    For each issue, determine:
    
    **Classification Matrix:**
    - **Type**: [Bug/Feature/Docs/Question/Duplicate]
    - **Priority**: [P0-Critical/P1-High/P2-Medium/P3-Low]
    - **Effort**: [XS/S/M/L/XL] (time estimate)
    - **Skills**: [Technical/Content/Design/Strategy]
    
    **Quick Decision Tree:**
    - Is it a duplicate? → Label and close
    - Is it critical (breaks user workflow)? → P0
    - Is it a quick fix (<1 hour)? → Fast-track
    - Does it need more info? → Request details
    - Otherwise → Standard triage
    
    **Output Format:**
    ```
    ISSUE: [title]
    CATEGORY: [type]-[priority]-[effort]
    ACTION: [immediate next step]
    OWNER: [suggested team/person]
    TIMELINE: [when to address]
    ```
    
    Process efficiently, ask for clarification only if absolutely necessary.
```

## Optimization Implementation

### Step 1: Baseline Performance Measurement

Create a performance testing prompt:

```yaml
performance-baseline:
  description: Establish baseline performance metrics for agent optimization
  prompt: |
    **Performance Baseline Testing Protocol:**
    
    Test each agent with standardized tasks and measure:
    
    **Quantitative Metrics:**

    - Output length (words/tokens)
    - Issue detection accuracy (%)
    - False positive rate (%)
    - Consistency score (1-10)
    
    **Qualitative Assessment:**
    - Output clarity and actionability
    - Adherence to specified format
    - Relevance to requested analysis
    - Professional quality of recommendations

1. **Optimize slow agents** by streamlining instructions
2. **Improve accuracy** by adding specific examples
3. **Enhance consistency** by standardizing output formats
4. **Reduce resource usage** by focusing scope

### Step 3: Continuous Monitoring

Set up ongoing performance tracking:

```yaml

  description: Ongoing performance monitoring and optimization tracking
  prompt: |
    **Agent Performance Dashboard:**
    
    Generate performance report covering:
    
    **System-Wide Metrics:**
    - Average response time by agent type
    - Overall accuracy rates and trends
    - User satisfaction indicators
    - System reliability and uptime
    
    **Individual Agent Performance:**
    - Top performing agents (speed + accuracy)
    - Agents needing optimization
    - Recent performance trends
    - Optimization impact measurement
    
    **Recommendations:**
    - Immediate optimization opportunities
    - Long-term improvement strategies
